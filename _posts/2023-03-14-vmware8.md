## The fun of VMWare in the homelab

Virtualization is awesome.  Taking a server, carving it up into a bunch
of other servers is just fun.  What a great way to experiment and learn.

Just went through the process of upgrading my VMWare 7.03 server up to 
VMware 8.  Not a bad process and I like what I am seeing in 8.  Great 
way to experiment before that happens at work.

I won't go through the process, but suffice it to say there are a 
ton of great resources to help get you there.   I did some research,
opted for the CLI method and boom, 20 minutes later all set.

Now time to figure out what new things I need to install.  I think 
next on the docket is well....docker.

I think I will lookup how to build a docker cluster on my raspberry pi's.

Four raspberry pi's on a 1U rack mount with POE pi hats.  So awesome.

Will save that for my next write up, or at least talk about version one,
and maybe work on version two....more to come.
