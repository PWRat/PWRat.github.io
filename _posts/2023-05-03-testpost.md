## March in Minnesota

Looking out the window, sun streams in, but snow sits on the ground.
The trees look dead, the bushes look brown, but the pavement is clear.

I know that pavement hides all those nasties of salt and sand.  Things a
motorcycle does not like. 

I don't want that salt on the bike, but I know in a week, two or maybe three...
Riding weather will be upon us.  I can't wait.  

Until that time......

There are scripts to write, linux programs to play with, and youtube videos to watch.

tick tock, tick tock....
